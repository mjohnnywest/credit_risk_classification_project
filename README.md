# Supervised Machine Learning Project
This is a project uses SKLearn to create a basic machine learning model that predicts whether a loan is high or low risk

## Features

- Splits data into training and testing datasets, which the model will use to understand the data, then applies the learned patterns to the testing dataset
- Creates a confusion matrix to evaluate the model's performace on the test dataset
- Creates a classification matrix to further evaluate the model's accuracy

## Requirements

- Python 3.13 or higher
- Any text editor compatable with ipynb files

Required libraries to pip install:

- pandas

- sklearn


## Usage

Ensure all required libaries are pip installed

Ensure "lending_data.csv" is in the "Resources" folder

Ensure the "Resources" folder is in the same folder as "credit_risk_classification.ipynb"

Open "credit_risk_classification.ipynb" with a text editor compatable with IYPNB files

Click "Run All" and allow the code to run

Ensure matricies and dataframes populate correctly
