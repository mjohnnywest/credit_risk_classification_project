# Supervised Machine Learning Project
This is a project uses SKLearn to create a basic machine learning model that predicts whether a loan is high or low risk

## Features

- Splits data into training and testing datasets, which the model will use to understand the data, then applies the learned patterns to the testing dataset
- Creates a confusion matrix to 
- Uses Principal Component Analysis to summarize and cluster data, and graph the clusters as well

## Requirements

- Python 3.13 or higher
- Any text editor compatable with ipynb files

Required libraries to pip install:

- pandas

- hvplot

- sklearn


## Usage

Ensure all required libaries are pip installed

Ensure "crypto_market_data.csv" is in the "Resources" folder

Ensure the "Resources" folder is in the same folder as "Crypto_Clustering_starter_code.ipynb"

Open "Crypto_Clustering_starter_code.ipynb" with a text editor compatable with IYPNB files

Click "Run All" and allow the code to run

Ensure all graphs and dataframes populate properly
